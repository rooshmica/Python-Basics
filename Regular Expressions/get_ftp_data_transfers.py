# Program to calculate amount of data transferred in xferlog log file

# Import the re module
import re

# Open the 'xferlog' file
with open('xferlog') as logfile:
	# Read in the entire contents
	contents = logfile.read()	

	# Use a regex "(\d+) /" to search for the data transfer and return a list of the values
	data_transfers = re.findall("(\d+) /", contents)
	
	# the values are stored in the list as strings
	print(data_transfers)

	# calculate the total of the data transfers
	total = 0
	for value in data_transfers:
		total += int(value)
	print("Total data transferred:",total, "bytes")
	
	# turn the values into numbers in one go (called a list comprehension)
	data_numbers = [ int(value) for value in data_transfers ]

	print("Total data transferred:",sum(data_numbers), "bytes")

	# calculate the largest value
	print("Maximum data transferred:",max(data_numbers), "bytes")
